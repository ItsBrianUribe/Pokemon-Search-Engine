# Pok√©mon Search Engine
### Description
Created the web application with React js and implemented the abiliaty to call on PokeAPI to receive the data requested and display it to the user. The search bar is not case sensitive so the user could mess with the caps for each letter and still get their result so long as they type in a valid Pokemon correctly. If the input is not related to an existing Pokemon or typed incorrectly, no info will be provided and the user will then be prompted to try again.
